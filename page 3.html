        This show was advertised and marketed to be advocacy towards depression, bullying, and suicide prevention/awareness. With that, not once was the word "depression" stated at all through the series.
                <br>
                <br>
            The idea of mental illness was overall avoided and pushed aside which was unfortunate to people who deserve the recognition. Although at the end there was a 30 minute segment about bullying and highschool, it wasn't nearly enough to make up for everything else was don e thorughout the series.
